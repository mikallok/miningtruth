      <h1>Copper-nickel mining is risky</h1></div>
  </div>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
  <p>Ore that bears copper, nickel and other valuable metals is known as sulfide ore, which is why the practice is sometimes called sulfide mining. Sulfide mining is risky because sulfuric acid is a by-product of the mining process. The acid is created when water and air combine with the waste rock generated as part of the mining process. In contrast, when water and air combine with waste rock from iron-ore mining, iron oxide, or rust, is the primary by-product.</p>

  <p>In Minnesota, mining proposals and exploration activities are primarily focused on extracting copper, nickel, platinum, palladium, and gold. These metals all serve important functions in modern society. Copper is used in electrical systems, automotive components, and wind turbines. Nickel is used to make stainless steel and hybrid car batteries. Platinum, palladium, and gold are used for making catalytic converters, fuel cells, medicine, computers, and jewelry.</p>

  <p>Mining metals in sulfide ores can be done in two ways: in underground mines where ore deposits are very deep and open-pit mines where deposits are very shallow. Mining companies often favor open-pit mines as they are less expensive to operate, but they also disturb a much larger amount of the surface. In the United States, 97 percent of all metals are now mined in open pits. Once the metals are extracted from the mined rock, the mine operator must find a way to dispose of large volumes of waste rock.</p>

Costs to taxpayers are expected to be more than $235 million dollars, and cleanup is expected to take 100 years.</figcaption>

  <h2>Has this type of mining been conducted safely?</h2>

  <p>Sulfide mining has a near-perfect track record of creating pollution. Mining companies are unable to point to a sulfide mine that has ever been developed, operated, and closed without producing polluted drainage from its operations. Because of the high costs of cleaning up and treating sulfide mines, and the history of mining companies abandoning mines and leaving taxpayers to deal with them, several states have strengthened their laws.</p>
  <p><b>Wisconsin.</b> In 1998, Wisconsin passed a moratorium for opening new sulfide mines until a similar mine could be demonstrated elsewhere that had been operating for ten years and closed for ten years without having created acid mine drainage. No sulfide mines have been proposed in the state since the law was passed.</p>
  <p><b>Montana.</b> After disastrous mining pollution and enormous financial liabilities, financial assurance amounts have increased from 50 percent of proposed mine cleanup costs to more than 10,000 percent.</p>
  <p><b>Arizona.</b> In early 2012, the U.S. Department of the Interior signed a 20-year moratorium for new hardrock mines on one million acres of federal land around Grand Canyon National Park.</p>
<p><b>New Mexico.</b> After experiencing significant pollution problems from two of its sulfide mines, financial assurance for the two mines was increased to roughly $400 million each.</p>
