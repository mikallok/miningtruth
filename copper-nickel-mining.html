      <h1>Copper-nickel mining is risky</h1></div>
  </div>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
  <p>Ore that bears copper, nickel and other valuable metals is known as sulfide ore, which is why the practice is sometimes called sulfide mining. Sulfide mining is risky because sulfuric acid is a byproduct of the mining process. The acid is created when water and air combine with the waste rock generated as part of the mining process. In contrast, when water and air combine with waste rock from iron-ore mining, iron oxide, or rust, is the primary byproduct.</p>

  <p>In Minnesota, mining proposals and exploration activities are primarily focused on extracting copper, nickel, platinum, palladium, and gold. All of these metals are found in sulfide ores, and they all serve important functions in modern society. Copper is used in electrical systems, automotive components, and in new wind turbines. Nickel is used to make stainless steel and hybrid car batteries. Platinum, palladium, and gold are used for making catalytic converters, fuel cells, medicine, computer components, and jewelry.</p>

  <p>Mining metals in sulfide ores can be done in two ways: in underground mines where ore deposits are very deep and open-pit mines where deposits are very shallow. Mining companies often favor open-pit mines as they are less expensive to design and operate, but they also disturb a much larger amount of the surface. In the United States, 97 percent of all metals are now mined in open pits. Once the metals of interest are chemically extracted from the mined rock, the mine operator must find a way to dispose of the remaining large volumes of waste rock.</p>

In 1992, the Summitville Mine, a sulfide ore mine in Colorado filed for bankruptcy. Costs to the taxpayers are expected to be more than $235 million dollars, and cleanup is expected to take 100 years. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency contractor applies lye in an effort to nuetralize sulfuric acid in the Animas River watershed that originated from a spill at the Gold King Mine in Colorado.</figcaption>
