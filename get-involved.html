    <h1>You can help protect Minnesota's environment</h1>

    <div class="col-sm-8">
      <p class="inside">As you read this, government officials both in Washington and St. Paul are moving rapidly toward a decision on whether sulfide mining should be permitted in Minnesota. This website was created on the idea of sharing the most current and accurate information on the proposals so that the people of Minnesota can make up their own minds on an issue that holds great importance for every last one of us.</p>
      <p class="inside">While many of the local supporters of this project believe that they deserve to have the final say on the proposal, the fact remains that all taxpayers in Minnesota will equally share any cleanup costs. If the PolyMetâ€™s estimates are correct and it takes 500 years of water treatment to get this site back to current status, the great grandchildren of a child born today in Hastings will owe just as much as the great grandchild of a child born today in Hoyt Lakes.</p>
<p class="inside">If you want to have your voice heard, it is important that you tell your elected officials. Your members of congress and the state legislature need to know what you think about this proposal. Use <a href="https://www.gis.leg.mn/iMaps/districts/" title="link to tool to find your elected representatives">this tool to find your elected officials</a>, then contact them to let them know what you think about the PolyMet mining proposal.
<h2 class="inside">What should you tell your elected officials?</h2>
<p class="inside">Your letter or email doesn't have to be long but keep in mind these key points.
<ul>
<li>Sulfide mining has never been conducted anywhere without significant environmental consequences.</li>
<li>Ask your representative whether he or she is certain that appropriate financial assurances are in place in the event of a disaster or to pay for cleanup when the mine closes.</li>
<li>Remind your representative that Minnesota's outdoor economy will indefinitely support far more jobs than mining.</li>
<li>Clean lands and waters contribute to the quality of life of all Minnesotans.</li>
