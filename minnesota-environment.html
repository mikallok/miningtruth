  <p>Minnesota has more than a century of history of iron mining, but sulfide mining has never been done in the state. There are important differences between sulfide and iron mining. Iron is found mostly in oxide ores, while copper, nickel and other metals are embedded in sulfide ores. Iron mining in Minnesota has been conducted in a stretch of northern Minnesota referred to as the Iron Range.</p>
<p>While sulfide mining proposals for Minnesota are also focused in the northern part of the state, they are proposed for the very eastern edge of the Iron Range and farther east into the Arrowhead region where mining has never occurred before.</p>
  <p>In the 1970s, a company called International Nickel operated briefly, looking for nickel in an area southeast of Ely. International Nickel drilled exploratory holes and at one site, dug up a bulk sample, essentially a small open pit mine. Almost immediately, the site began discharging pollution. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency required the company to correct the problem. In 2010, contaminated seepage was still found to be discharging from the site.</p>

  <h2>How could this type of mining affect our lakes and rivers?</h2>

  <p>The outdoor recreation industry is responsible for 140,000 direct jobs, $4.5 billion in wages, and $1.4 billion in local and state taxes. Much of this activity takes place in northern Minnesota.</p>
