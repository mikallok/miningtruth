  <p>Minnesota has more than a century of history of iron mining, but sulfide mining has never been done in the state. There are important differences between sulfide and iron mining. Iron is found mostly in oxide ores, while copper, nickel and other metals are embedded in sulfide ores. Iron mining in Minnesota has been conducted in a stretch of northern Minnesota referred to as the Iron Range.</p>
<p>While sulfide mining proposals for Minnesota are also focused in the northern part of the state, they are proposed for the very eastern edge of the Iron Range and farther east into the Arrowhead region where mining has never occurred before.</p>
  <p>In the 1970s, a company called International Nickel operated briefly, looking for nickel in an area southeast of Ely. International Nickel drilled exploratory holes and at one site, dug up a bulk sample, essentially a small open pit mine. Almost immediately, the site began discharging pollution. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency required the company to correct the problem. In 2010, contaminated seepage was still found to be discharging from the site.</p>

  <h2>How could this type of mining affect Minnesota's environement?</h2>

  <p>Sulfide mining has a near-perfect track record of creating pollution.  Mining companies are unable to point to a sulfide mine that has ever been developed, operated and closed without producing polluted drainage from its operations. Here's what that could mean for Minnesota:</p>
  <p><b>Human health.</b> Mining by-products such as arsenic, manganese, and thallium, have been shown in high levels to increase the risk of cancer and other illnesses in humans. Because mining takes place below the water table, it can contaminate groundwater, threatening drinking water supplies.</p>
  <p><b>Fish.</b> Fishing is a popular pastime in Minnesota, and an important economic engine in the region where sulfide mining is proposed. Fish that come into contact with sulfide mining drainage can die from the toxic chemicals and acidic water. The pollution can also destroy their food sources and habitat.</p>
  <p><b>Birds.</b> Unlike with most iron mining, sulfide mining pit lakes can be highly acidic. Unsuspecting migratory waterfowl and other wildlife may use the pit-lakes as resting places or water sources and become poisoned.</p>
<p><b>Wetlands.</b> The destruction of more than 1,000 acres of wetlands at the PolyMet mine site would be the single largest loss of wetlands ever permitted in Minnesota. Wetlands are also destroyed when mining pulls water from an area, drying them up. Additionally, a loophole in the Clean Water Act allows mining companies to dump waste into wetlands.</p>
