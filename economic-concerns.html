    <h1>Is mining good for the economy?</h1>
  </div>
    <div class="col-sm-8">
      <p class="inside">The PolyMet Mining Corporation, a Canadian company, estimates that Minnesota's first sulfide mine will create about 360 full-time jobs.</p>
<p class="inside">The Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the mine project reveals that 55 percent of those jobs will be non-local hires, filled by people relocating to the area. Another 20 percent of the hires will be commuting from distant locations such as Duluth. Only 25 percent, or 90 of the predicted jobs, might come from the local communities, according to the PolyMet proposal.</p>
<p class="inside">In contrast, Minnesota's outdoor recreation industry is responsible for 140,000 direct jobs, $4.5 billion in wages, and $1.4 billion in local and state taxes. Much of this activity takes place in northern Minnesota, and sulfide mining could put the long-term health of the state's outdoor recreation industry at risk.</p>
<p class="inside">
Examinations of similar mines elsewhere in the country show a pattern of fluctuating
employment even when mines are operating. Employment at mines is subject to the volatility of the global metals market, technical problems at the facility, safety issues and temporary closures. Mines may meet their employment targets, but may be unable to maintain that target over time. Repeated lay-offs and mine closures contribute to economic instability for a mining-dependent community.</p>
      <h2 class="inside">How are taxpayers affected by sulfide mining?</h2>
<p class="inside">It is quite common for mining companies to go out of business when a mine closes.  Corporations created for specific mining projects with backing of international investors have little incentive to stay in business if mining operations are completed or if mineral prices fall significantly.</p>
<p class="inside">When companies are unwilling or unable to pay for the cost of cleaning up a mine site, the cost of treating sulfide mining pollution becomes a liability for taxpayers and affected communities.</p>
<h2 class="inside">How does this happen?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Mineral exploration discovers a viable mine site.</li>
<li>A major corporation funds a junior corporation to operate the mine and protect the assets of the major corporation. </li>
<li>Profits from mineral extraction are funneled to the major corporation. </li>
<li>When the mine is exhausted, the major corporation’s investment value declines. </li>
<li>Cleanup of mining waste begins, but, because all of the junior corporation’s profits went to the major corporation, money soon runs out. </li>
<li>The major corporation’s assets are protected, so the decades-long cleanup is funded by taxpayers. </li>
<li>The mining site sometimes becomes a superfund site.</li>
</ol>
